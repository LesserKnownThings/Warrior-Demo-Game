# Warrior-Demo-Game
<h2> A small turn based game I made with unity as a showcase for an interview with a company. </h2>

<h3> The menu is pretty confusing, this is what you have to do to start the game</h2>
<ul>
<li>Press on a hero on the right screen, read their stats and then press on the button on the left screen to pick the hero</li>
<li>Each player gets a turn to pick his/her heroes, once that's done the game starts</a>
<li>In the game each gets one turn to move, attack or cast a spell</li>
<li>Some spells have - damage instead of normal damage, that means that instead of doing damage they heal and can only be used on your unitys</a>
</ul>
